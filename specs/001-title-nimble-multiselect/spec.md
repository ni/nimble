# Feature Specification: nimble-multiselect (multi-select component)

**Feature Branch**: `001-title-nimble-multiselect`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "build a new multi-select component. It should have the same features and capabilities as the nimble-select component (including filtering items), but allow the user to select one or more items. When an item is selected, the control should summarize the selected items, and the dropdown menu should include a check next to each menu-item." 

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a form author or UI developer, I want a multi-select control that behaves like `nimble-select` but supports picking multiple entries so that end-users can choose zero, one, or many items from a list, filter the list by typing, and see a concise summary of their selections in the closed control.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a `nimble-multiselect` with three options, when the user opens the dropdown and clicks one option, then that option becomes selected, a check appears next to it in the dropdown, and the control shows that single option's label as the summary.
2. Given several selected options, when the user opens the dropdown, then each selected option is shown with a check indicator next to its menu item.
3. Given several selected options, when the user closes the control, then the control's summary shows a comma-separated list of selected item labels (or a configurable summarized form if label overflow occurs).
4. Given the control has `filter-mode` enabled, when the user types into the filter field, then items are filtered case-insensitively (diacritic-insensitively) and the dropdown shows only matching items.
5. Given the control is configured with `clearable`, when the user clicks the clear button, then all selections are cleared and the control emits appropriate `input`/`change` events.
6. Given options with `hidden` or grouped via `nimble-list-option-group`, the multi-select honors visibility semantics the same as `nimble-select` (hidden options are not selectable unless explicitly intended).

### Edge Cases
- Selecting options programmatically should update the control summary and emit change events consistent with user-initiated selection.
- When many items are selected (long list), the summary may overflow; the control must provide a tooltip/title with the full list when truncated.
- Disabled or visually-hidden options cannot be selected by user interaction.
- When filter-mode is manual, the component must still render items provided externally and expose `filter-input` events.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: The system MUST provide a `nimble-multiselect` custom element with the same public behavioral surface as `nimble-select` (appearance, filter-mode, clearable, open, disabled, requiredVisible, etc.), except that it supports multi-selection.
- FR-002: The component MUST allow selecting one or more items via click and keyboard (space/enter), and keep multiple items selected concurrently.
- FR-003: The component MUST display a concise summary of selected items in the closed control; default behavior: single selected item shows its label, multiple selected items show comma-separated labels.
- FR-004: The dropdown list MUST render a visual check indicator beside each selected menu item when the dropdown is open.
- FR-005: The component MUST support the same filtering behavior as `nimble-select` (standard/manual/none) including diacritic-insensitive matching.
- FR-006: The component MUST emit `input` and `change` events when selections are changed by the user.
- FR-007: The component MUST integrate with forms and set proxy `<select multiple>` state so form submissions include selected values.
- FR-008: The component MUST support keyboard navigation and selection patterns equivalent to `nimble-select` (arrow keys, home/end, typeahead), and support toggling selection with Space/Enter when focused on options.
- FR-009: The component MUST expose an accessible API (aria-multiselectable, aria-selected on options) and maintain focus/aria attributes analogous to the `nimble-select`.
- FR-010: The component MUST support option groups (`nimble-list-option-group`) and maintain separators and visibility behavior consistent with `nimble-select`.

*Ambiguities / configuration choices (marked):*
- FR-003.1: Summary truncation strategy: default is comma-separated labels.
- FR-004.1: Check indicator rendering: reuse the existing `nimble-icon-check` in each option's start slot.

### Key Entities *(UI-level, no persisted data)*
- **Multiselect component**: represents the control instance (state: open, selectedOptions[], filter text, disabled, requiredVisible, etc.).
- **Option**: `nimble-list-option` with value/text and attributes (disabled, hidden, visually-hidden, selected).

Notes / Next steps
- Implement a prototype `nimble-multiselect` in `packages/nimble-components/src/multiselect/` mirroring `nimble-select` implementation and tests.
- Decide how to render check indicators (icon vs CSS) and how to summarize long selections (configurable template or "n items selected").

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
