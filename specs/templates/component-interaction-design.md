*The name of the component, along with high-level description of what the design includes.*

### Background

*Relevant historical or background information, including:*
- *Additional client research that isn't captured in linked issues*
- *Link to Interaction Design issue*
- *Link to relevant work items, related existing issues, etc.*

## Usage

- *How, when, and where should you use this component?*
- *Compare this component with other related components. How does it differ?*
- *How should you decide between related components?*
- *Should the component support alternate visual styles? (e.g. primary, outline, block, ghost, disabled)*
- *When should you use alternate visual styles?*

## Design

- *Full description of the proposed interaction design.*
- *Include links or embedded views of design in XD or Figma and provide any additional context.*
- *Include accessibility considerations like keyboard interactions and ARIA role/states/properties*

## Validation

- *Quote or link to feedback from design reviews. New interaction design patterns require broad support from design stakeholders (IxD, ViD, POs) before they can be adopted within Nimble.*
- *Quote or link to feedback from user feedback. All interaction design patterns should be user tested with some combination of internal and external users. Consult with the User Research team for low-cost ways to validate your design.*

## Open Issues

*Highlight any open questions for discussion during the spec PR. Before the spec is approved these should typically be resolved with the answers being incorporated in the spec document.*
