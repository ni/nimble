### API

*Include a permalink to FAST's API documentation (from the FAST component spec on GitHub, press `y` to update the URL bar to show the latest commit)*
*Provide a brief summary of the API below. For each section:*
    *If exposing FAST's API without changes, you can just write "Unchanged".*
    *If deviating from FAST's API, highlight and provide an explanation for the changes.*

*The API summary should include:*
- *Component Name*
- *Properties/Attributes*
- *Methods*
- *Events*
- *CSS Classes and Custom Properties that affect the component*
- *Slots*

### Angular integration 

*Describe the plan for Angular support, including directives for attribute binding and ControlValueAccessor for form integration. Depending on the contributor's needs, implementing Angular integration may be deferred but the initial spec should still document what work will be needed.*

### Blazor integration 

*Describe the plan for Blazor support. See the [nimble-blazor CONTRIBUTING.md](/packages/nimble-blazor/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details. Depending on the contributor's needs, implementing Blazor integration may be deferred but the initial spec should still document what work will be needed.*

### Additional requirements

*Review the following areas and add brief commentary on each. Highlight any gaps which might require additional work, bugs to be filed to FAST, or write "None" if there are no special requirements.*

- *User interaction: Do the FAST component's behaviors match the visual design spec? When they differ, which approach is preferable and why?*
- *Styling: Does FAST provide APIs to achieve the styling in the visual design spec?*
- *Testing: Is FAST's coverage sufficient? Should we write any tests beyond Chromatic visual tests?*
- *Documentation: Any requirements besides standard Storybook docs and updating the Example Client App demo?*
- *Tooling: Any new tools, updates to tools, code generation, etc?*
- *Accessibility: keyboard navigation/focus, form input, use with assistive technology, etc.*
- *Globalization: special RTL handling, swapping of icons/visuals, localization, etc.*
- *Performance: does the FAST component meet Nimble's performance requirements?*
- *Security: Any requirements for security?*

## Open Issues

*Highlight any open questions for discussion during the spec PR. Before the spec is approved these should typically be resolved with the answers being incorporated in the spec document.*
