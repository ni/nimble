# üßê üìÑ New component spec process

Before building a new component, create a spec document and review it in a pull request to get agreement on the component's behavior, API, and high-level implementation.

The process to create and approve a spec is:

1. In a new branch, create a copy of one of the following spec templates. Place the copy in this `specs` directory next to the template with a name similar to other specs but unique to the component you are proposing.
   - if the new component will be based on an existing FAST component, use the [abbreviated template](/specs/TEMPLATE-FAST.md).
   - if the new component will be built from scratch or built on top of a different library, use the [full template](/specs/TEMPLATE.md).
2. Fill in the fields of the spec. Be sure to remove any boilerplate from the spec template which was not used. 
3. Add a link to your spec from the [component status table in the root README.md](/README.md#component-status).
4. Create a pull request for the branch to discuss the spec with Nimble maintainers.
5. Approval and merging of the pull request indicates approval to proceed with building the component! ü•≥
