# Incubating components

Components are marked as **Incubating** when they're not yet ready for general use.
A component could be in this state if any of the following are true:

-   It is still in development.
-   It is currently experimental or application-specific and hasn't yet been generalized for broader use.
-   It is missing important features like interaction design, visual design, or accessibility.

See the issue linked from each component's documentation for more information about what it's missing.

## Using incubating components

Please talk to the Nimble team before using incubating components in production.
Note that incubating components may make breaking changes without a corresponding `major` version bump.
