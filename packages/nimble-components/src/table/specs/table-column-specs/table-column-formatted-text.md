# Formatted Text Columns

## Overview

Clients will wish to display non-string data as text in table columns for use cases like the following:

1. integer data like counts, formatted to be displayed with no trailing decimals ("4", "100")
2. floating point data formatted to display values in standard ways ("3.1415", "1.04E47", "Infinity", "-0.03")
3. a mix of the above with formatting determined by the application ("1.000", "-0.030", "1024.000")
4. numeric values with a static unit string appended before or after (e.g. "$4.23" or "15%")
5. numeric values with custom unit logic. Examples:
    - a file size column that could show the value 1000 as "1000 bytes" but the value 1024 as "1KB"
    - an elapsed time column that could show 63 seconds as "00:01:03" or "1 minute, 3 seconds"
6. date/time values formatted in various ways ("October 27", "yesterday", "2023-12-28 08:27")

In all of the above cases:

-   data should be sortable and groupable by its actual value, not the string representation
-   text styling like font and alignment should be provided by Nimble
-   columns should support i18n behaviors like decimal separators, date/time formats, and localized content
-   there should be an option to show "placeholder" text if no value is specified
-   there should be a way to show the full value of truncated text (likely via a title / tooltip on hover)

We may not choose to support all of the above initially but we should design our solutions with these use cases in mind.

### Non-goals

-   Combinations of the use cases listed above in a single column. This will be needed in cases where the source data isn't uniformly typed (e.g. SLE tag values or notebook outputs). This HLD focuses on uniform data types; future HLDs may discuss ways to configure multiple types of columns to be conditionally displayed together.
-   Editable numbers. This is not supported by the text column yet either.
-   Numeric formatting for `nimble-number-field`. While we may choose to expose similar APIs for its numeric formatting, the complexities of it being an editable input control make this out of scope for now.
-   Customizing the styling of the column content (other than text alignment). This is not supported by the text column yet either.
-   Enum and boolean values formatted as localized strings (0 -> "Fail", 1 -> "Pass"). These will likely use the [mapping column being discussed elsewhere](https://github.com/ni/nimble/pull/1220).

## Design

### Summary

Nimble will provide base classes that can be derived from to define columns that call a formatting function to render their data as text.

Nimble will provide several columns that derive from these base classes and provide higher level formatting APIs for specific data types. We plan to provide column implementations that can handle the above use cases 1-4 (numeric formatting and static units) in a first pass with 6 (date) coming later.

Clients which require app-specific formatting logic to support above use cases like 5 (custom unit logic) will define custom columns in their application that derive from these base classes.

We'll strongly encourage clients to prefer columns defined in Nimble as these will be easier to use than custom columns defined in their application:

-   the columns will be configurable via HTML attributes, saving clients from writing JS code (a particular challenge in Blazor)
-   they provide strict type validation of the data field
-   clients don't need to manage the lifecycle of registering a new column custom element in their application

### Formatted text column base classes

Nimble will provide abstract base classes, templates, and styles which handle rendering a string as text. Just like `nimble-table-column-text` today, these columns will:

-   offer attributes to control which field is displayed and placeholder text when that field isn't of type "number" (values like Infinity and NaN are considered numbers and will be displayed as such).
-   sort and group by the field value, not the display value.
-   allow sizing by fractional widths with a minimum pixel width.
-   truncate using an ellipsis and show a tooltip on hover when the value is truncated

The base classes provided will be:

-   `TableColumnTextBase` - specifies the custom element logic to configure the column
-   `TableColumnTextCellViewBase` - derives from `TableCellView` to specify the custom element logic that renders a cell
-   `TableColumnTextGroupHeaderViewBase` - derives from `TableGroupHeaderView` to specify the custom element logic that renders a group row

Both clients and Nimble itself will derive from these base classes to specify the type of data that the column supports and how to convert it to a string. They will register the derived classes as custom elements using the same FAST APIs that Nimble itself uses.

**Use column custom element in an application**

```html
<nimble-table>
    <my-app-progress-column
        field-name="progress"
        placeholder="Not started"
    >
        Progress
    <my-app-progress-column>`
</nimble-table>
```

**Define and register column custom element**

```ts
export class MyAppProgressColumn extends TableColumnTextBase {
    protected override getColumnInternalsOptions(): ColumnInternalsOptions {
        return {
            cellRecordFieldNames: ['value'],
            cellViewTag: tableColumnNumericTextCellViewTag,
            groupHeaderViewTag: tableColumnNumericTextGroupHeaderTag,
            sortOperation: TableColumnSortOperation.basic
        };
    }
}

const myAppProgressColumn = MyAppProgressColumn.compose({
    baseName: 'table-column-progress',
    template,
    styles
});

DesignSystem.getOrCreate().withPrefix('my-app').register(myAppProgressColumn());
export const myAppProgressColumnTag = DesignSystem.tagFor(MyAppProgressColumn);
```

**Specify formatting of cells and group headers in their custom elements**

```ts
export class MyAppProgressColumnCellView extends TableColumnTextCellViewBase<
    TableColumnNumericTextCellRecord,
    TableColumnNumericTextColumnConfig
> {
    public override get text(): string {
        return `${100 * this.cellRecord.value}%`;
    }

    public override get placeholder(): string {
        return this.columnConfig.placeholder;
    }

    public override get shouldUsePlaceholder(): boolean {
        return typeof this.cellRecord.value !== 'number';
    }
}

export class MyAppProgressColumnGroupHeaderView extends TableColumnTextGroupHeaderViewBase<
    TableNumberFieldValue,
    TableColumnNumericTextColumnConfig
> {
    public override get text(): string {
        return `${100 * this.groupHeaderValue}%`;
    }

    public override get placeholder(): string {
        return this.columnConfig.placeholder;
    }

    public override get shouldUsePlaceholder(): boolean {
        return typeof this.groupHeaderValue !== 'number';
    }
}

// Not shown: registering the above two custom elements
```

This is prototyped in the [formatted-text-column branch](https://github.com/ni/nimble/compare/main...users/jattas/formatted-text-column?expand=1).

### Nimble formatted text columns

Nimble will provide several columns that derive from the above base classes and provide higher level text formatting APIs for specific data types.

#### Column naming

Follows the [Column Type Philosophy](/packages/nimble-components/src/table/specs
/table-columns-hld.md#column-type-philosophy) where:

-   category: `table-column`
-   presentation: `text`
-   variants: Different variants are allowed for configurations that vary significantly / don't make sense to add to `table-column-text`, ie for a `table-column-numeric-text` or `table-column-date-text`

#### Text column

`nimble-table-column-text` will continue to present the same API it does today, but will derive from the base classes described above.

#### Numeric column

Nimble could introduce `nimble-table-column-numeric-text` which formats a numeric field value and displays it as text. It will offer sufficient configuration to support use cases 1-4 above.

The API will be specified in a future update to this document. Below is **an example API** that leverages the native browser [`Intl.NumberFormat` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat): this is intended to help visualize what the API _could_ look like, but isn't yet finalized.

```html
<nimble-table>
    <nimble-table-column-number
        field-name="count"
        number-format-locales="en-US"
        number-format-options-style="decimal"
        number-format-options-use-grouping="false"
        number-format-options-maximum-fraction-digits="0"
        number-format-options-rounding-mode="trunc"
    >
        Count
    </nimble-table-column-number>

    <nimble-table-column-number
        field-name="voltage"
        number-format-locales="en-US"
        number-format-options-style="decimal"
        number-format-options-use-grouping="false"
        suffix=" V"
    >
        Voltage
    </nimble-table-column-number>
</nimble-table>
```

##### Date Column

Nimble could introduce `nimble-table-column-date-text` which maps date-time values to localized strings. The API will be specified in a future update to this document. It will need to consider cases like date formatting (both for locale and other reasons) and how to provide localized strings, possibly by exposing [the native browser `Intl.DateTimeFormat` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat).

#### Other ways to provide a formatting function

1. setting the formatting function as a property on a column element.
2. registering a formatter with Nimble using a unique string name and then configuring the column to use that formatter by an attribute (described in more detail [in Milan's comment](https://github.com/ni/nimble/pull/1054#discussion_r1136319757))
3. setting an [`Intl.NumberFormat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat) object as a property on a column element.

All of these require JS code which finds a specific column element and configures it. This is difficult to achieve in Blazor.

#### Use `table-column-text`

With the changes proposed in [HLD for programmatically sorting columns](../table-column-sort-hld.md) to allow a column to be sorted by a different data field than the one being used for display, many of the above use cases could be met with minor changes to the existing text column. Clients would write custom logic to populate their data with a new string field that contains formatted values. Then they would configure the table to display that string field while sorting by the original numeric field.

```html
<nimble-table>
    <nimble-table-column-text
        operand-data-record-name="progress"
        field-name="formattedProgress"
    >
        Progress
    <nimble-table-column-text>`
</nimble-table>
```

```ts
const originalData = [{ progress: 0.1 }, { progress: 0.2 }];
const tableData = originalData.map(x => {
    progress: x.progress;
    formattedProgress: x ? `${100 * x.progress}%` : undefined;
});
table.setData(tableData);
```

**Pros:**

-   formatted data is specified up front, guaranteeing fast scroll performance
-   powerful; clients can format data however they want, including via browser APIs which are i18n-friendly or via server-side logic

**Cons:**

-   Increased memory usage and data update time from clients pre-populating data with field for each formatted column
-   Added complexity of writing procedural code even for simple numeric formatting use cases
-   Potential cross-app inconsistency if numeric formatting code isn't shared (versus Alternative 3)
-   Difficult to enforce styling differences between string and numeric columns (e.g. right vs left text alignment)

**Implementation Cost:**

-   Exposing `operand-data-record-name` to be set by client code rather than column definition
-   Exposing an API for clients to indicate their data should be styled as numeric data (right aligned)

#### Client provides custom column implementation for each use case

Nimble already has a mechanism for clients to provide custom columns by deriving from a base class, specifying the data fields / template / styling, and registering the column type with Nimble. We could ask clients to use this mechanism for text column types.

**Pros:**

-   Zero implementation cost to Nimble team
-   Powerful; clients can format data however they want, including via browser APIs which are i18n-friendly

**Cons:**

-   Higher burden on clients to specify template, styling, numeric formatting, etc in JS. This is especially burdensome in frameworks like Blazor.
-   Difficult to enforce styling differences between string and numeric columns (e.g. right vs left text alignment)
-   Potential cross-app inconsistency if formatting code isn't shared

This will be filled out in more detail, but some reminders:

-   handle number edge cases (-Inf, Inf, -0, +0, NaN, Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER + n, Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER -n) as numbers
-   handle non-number edge cases (strings containing numbers, undefined, null)

## Open Issues

1. API to configure text alignment of column content, placeholder text, and column headers (e.g. right align numeric columns but left align string columns and numeric columns with non-uniform formatting; [more discussion here](https://github.com/ni/nimble/issues/887)). We'll update the HLD with a recommendation when we start working on columns that need it (you're welcome to comment with ideas now though).
