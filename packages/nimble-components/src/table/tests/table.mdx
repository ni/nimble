<Meta of={tableStories} />
<Title of={tableStories} />

The <Tag name={tableTag}/> is a component that offers a way to render tabular data in a variety of ways in each column.
For information about configuring table columns, see **Table Column Configuration** and **Table Column Types**.

<Canvas of={tableStories.table} />
<Controls of={tableStories.table} />

## Delay-loaded Hierarchy

In some cases, it may be known that a record has children, but the records for those children are not known. For performance reasons, it may be preferred to load
the children on demand when a user expands the parent row. To accomplish this, use the `setRecordHierarchyOptions()` function on the table to set the hierarchy
options associated with records in the data.

<Canvas of={tableStories.delayedHierarchy} />
<Controls of={tableStories.delayedHierarchy} />

### Delay-loaded Hierarchy Usage

The expected usage of the dynamically loaded hierarchy is as follows:

1. Configure `idFieldName` and `parentIdFieldName` on the table
1. Call `setData` on the table with the records that are known
1. Call `setRecordHierarchyOptions` with an option of `{ delayedHierarchyState: TableRecordDelayedHierarchyState.canLoadChildren }` for IDs associated with records that are known to have children that have not been loaded.
1. Handle the `row-expand-toggle` event on the table by doing the following for rows that need to dynamically load their data:
    1. Start loading the data in the background.
    1. Call `setRecordHierarchyOptions` on the table to update the state of the row whose data is being loaded to `{ delayedHierarchyState: TableRecordDelayedHierarchyState.loadingChildren }`. This call must include the current state of any records not in the default state.
1. When the dynamically loaded data has finished loading, do the following based on the result of loading data:
    - If loading the data succeeds:
        1. Call `setData` on the table with the new data
        1. Call `setRecordHierarchyOptions` with the current row options for each row that is either still loading or still has data that hasn't been loaded yet.
    - If loading the data fails but can be tried again:
        1. Call `setRecordHierarchyOptions` to change the row state back to `{ delayedHierarchyState: TableRecordDelayedHierarchyState.canLoadChildren }`. This call must include the current state of any records not in the default state.
    - If loading the data determines that the row doesn't actually have children:
        1. Call `setRecordHierarchyOptions` to change the row state to `{ delayedHierarchyState: TableRecordDelayedHierarchyState.none }`. This call must include the current state of any records not in the default state.

### setRecordHierarchyOptions Behavior

`setRecordHierarchyOptions()` has the following behavior:

-   all options will be cleared when the table's `idFieldName` changes
-   an option passed to `setRecordHierarchyOptions` with an ID that does not match a record in the data will be ignored
-   the options passed to `setRecordHierarchyOptions` will override any options previously set to become the complete set of options configured on the table
-   the table will not render delayed hierarchy state (loading or expandable) if the table's `parentIdFieldName` is not configured; however, the options will remain cached within the table if the `parentIdFieldName` becomes `undefined`, and that cached configuration will render in the table if the table's `parentIdFieldName` is changed back to a non-`undefined` value
-   calling `setData` will clear options associated with IDs that are no longer present in the data
-   a row with no children and a `delayedHierarchyState` of `canLoadChildren` will always be collapsed

## Styling

The <Tag name={tableTag}/> should be sized explicitly or sized to fill the space of a parent container. The <Tag name={tableTag}/> does not currently support being styled with `height: auto`. The ability to auto size the table is tracked with [issue 1624](https://github.com/ni/nimble/issues/1624).
