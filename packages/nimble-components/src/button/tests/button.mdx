Per [W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/button/) - A button is a widget that
enables users to trigger an action or event, such as submitting a form, opening a dialog, canceling an
action, or performing a delete operation.

If you want a button that triggers navigation to a URL, use the <Tag name={anchorButtonTag}/> instead.

<Canvas of={buttonStories.outlineButton} />
<Controls of={buttonStories.outlineButton} />

<StylingDocs components={{ Button: buttonTag }} />

## Sizing

Nimble Buttons are currently always 32px tall. Designs exist for other sizes; if you need these in an application, please comment on [Configurable height for nimble controls (#610)](https://github.com/ni/nimble/issues/610).

## Accessibility

Please work with your designer and ensure you have a 4.5:1
contrast ratio text to background.

<ContentHiddenDocs buttonElement="nimble-button" />
