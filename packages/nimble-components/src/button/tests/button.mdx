# Usage Docs

<br />

## Sizing

    Nimble Buttons are currently always 32px tall. Designs exist for other sizes; if you need these in an application, please comment on [Configurable height for nimble controls (#610)](https://github.com/ni/nimble/issues/610).

## Styling / Theme

    Use the Color UI version for backgrounds with color (e.g. purple, blue).

    See the usage details for more information on button styling / usage.

## Accessibility

    Please work with your designer and ensure you have a 4.5:1
    contrast ratio text to background.

    When using the button with only an icon, `contentHidden` should be set to `true` and text content should be provided within the button
    even though it will not be visible on the screen. The button will use the text content to configure the appropriate ARIA attributes internally
    to ensure the button is adequately accessible with a screen reader.
