# Usage Docs

<br />

## Sizing

    Nimble Buttons are currently always 32px tall. Designs exist for other sizes; if you need these in an application, please comment on [Configurable height for nimble controls (#610)](https://github.com/ni/nimble/issues/610).

## Styling / Theme

    Use the Color UI version for backgrounds with color (e.g. purple, blue).

    See the usage details for more information on button styling / usage.

## Accessibility

    Please work with your designer and ensure you have a 4.5:1
    contrast ratio text to background.
