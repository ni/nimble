# Usage Docs

<br />

## Sizing

    The label button has two sizes: 32px and 24px, while the icon only button has two smaller sizes: 18px and 16px.

    32px buttons are the default sized control and should be used first, while 24px buttons should only be used if there's limited space.
    24px buttons should not be used in combination with 32px buttons.

    18px buttons are used to nest within controls, as 16px buttons are generally too small.
    Icons are drawn within a 16px space and can sometimes consume the full width or height; this leaves no room for visual interaction bounds.
    Both 16px and 18px buttons are too small for touch interactions.  18’s are 23% larger than 16’s and help increase the hit zone for a cursor.

    16px buttons are the bare minimum size to use in the event icons need to vertically stack next to a 32px control.
    <h5>These should be used very sparingly and only if necessary.</h5>

## Styling / Theme

    Use the Color UI version for backgrounds with color (e.g. purple, blue).

    See the usage details for more information on button styling / usage.

## Accessibility

    Please work with your designer and insure you have a 4.5:1
    contrast ratio text to background.
