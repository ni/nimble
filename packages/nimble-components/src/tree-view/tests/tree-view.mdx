Per [W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/) - A tree view widget
presents a hierarchical list. Any item in the hierarchy may have child items, and items that have
children may be expanded or collapsed to show or hide the children. For example, in a file system
navigator that uses a tree view to display folders and files, an item representing a folder can be
expanded to reveal the contents of the folder, which may be files, folders, or both.

The \`nimble-tree-view\` supports standard \`nimble-tree-item\`s and \`nimble-anchor-tree-item\`s,
which navigate to a url upon activation. Both types of tree items support icons as slotted content.
