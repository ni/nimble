    The <Tag name={spinnerTag}/> is an animating indicator that can be placed in a
    particular region of a page to represent loading progress, or an
    ongoing operation, of an indeterminate / unknown duration.

    It has 3 sizes (64px, 32px, and 16px) and 2 appearance types (default and
    accent).

<Canvas of={spinnerStories.spinner} />
<Controls of={spinnerStories.spinner} />

## Sizing

The 64px spinner is a less commonly used size reserved for large negative empty space. Only one 64px spinner should be used on a single screen at one time.

The 32px spinner is a more commonly used size for negative empty space. No more than three 32px spinners should be used on a single screen at one time.

The 16px spinner is the most compact option for tight spaces such as grid cells and dense UI interfaces without much negative empty space.

Multiple 16px spinners can be used on a single screen at one time.

## Styling / Theme

Use the `default` appearance Color UI version for backgrounds with color (e.g. purple, blue). Do not use the `accent` appearance on any colored backgrounds, instead use the `default` Color UI version.

See the `size` and `appearance` usage details for information on customizing the spinner size and guidance for which appearance to use.

## Accessibility

A low-motion/low-frame rate version of the spinner is also available. It can be activated by enabling `prefers-reduced-motion`.

When using colored backgrounds, confirm with your designer that a 3:1 contrast ratio is met.
