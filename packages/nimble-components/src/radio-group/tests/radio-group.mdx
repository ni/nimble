Per [W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/radio/) - A radio group is a set of checkable buttons, known as radio buttons, where no more than one of the buttons can be checked at a time. Some implementations may initialize the set with all buttons in the unchecked state in order to force the user to check one of the buttons before moving past a certain point in the workflow.

<DocsStory of={radioGroupStories.radioGroup} expanded={false} />
<Controls of={radioGroupStories.radioGroup} />

### Angular Usage

The Angular CVA for the radio button group ignores the value of `callSetDisabledState` configured on the form module.
Instead, it always uses the default value of `'always'`.
