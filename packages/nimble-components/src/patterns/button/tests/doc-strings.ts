    <summary>Icon Usage</summary>
    Icons should be consistent and only used when necessary.

    <ul>
        <li>Icon and text buttons: 
            <br/>Use a label plus icon to help reinforce a button's functionality, and increase the visual impact of the action.  
            It should promote additional clarity, and should not be used solely for decoration. 
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>Icon only buttons: 
            <br/>Use primarily for the purpose of limited space, and when the button's action is common and expected.
            <br/>Replicate the usage to create patterns, but do not assume the user will understand the icon's meaning.
            <br/>When a label isn't present, use a tooltip to give extra information.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>
                Be sure to use consistent label and icon styling for groups of buttons. Do not mix button types with grouped items.
            </h4>
        </li>
