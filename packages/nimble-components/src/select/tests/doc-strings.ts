export const filterModeDescription = "This attribute controls the filtering behavior of the `Select`. The default of `none` results in a dropdown with no input for filtering. A non-'none' setting results in a search input placed at the top or the bottom of the dropdown when opened (depending on where the popup is shown relative to the component). The `standard` setting will perform a case-insensitive and diacritic-insensitive filtering of the available options anywhere within the text of each option.";
