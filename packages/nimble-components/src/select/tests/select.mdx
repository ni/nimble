Select is a control for selecting among a set of options. It's also known as a **dropdown** or a **select-only combobox**.

The value comes from the `value` of the currently selected `nimble-list-option`, or, if no value exists for
that option, the option's content. Upon clicking on the element, the other options are visible. The user cannot
manually enter values, and thus the list cannot be filtered.
