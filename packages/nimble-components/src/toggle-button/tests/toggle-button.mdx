Per [W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/button/) - A toggle button is a two-state button
that can be either off (not pressed) or on (pressed). For example, a button labeled mute in an audio player could
indicate that sound is muted by setting the pressed state true. Important: it is critical the label on a toggle does
not change when its state changes. In this example, when the pressed state is true, the label remains "Mute" so a
screen reader would say something like "Mute toggle button pressed".
