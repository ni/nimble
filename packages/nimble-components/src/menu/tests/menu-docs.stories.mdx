# Example Menu Guidelines

As defined by the W3C:

> A menu is a widget that offers a list of choices to the user, such as a set of actions or functions. Menu widgets behave like native
operating system menus, such as the menus that pull down from the menubars commonly found at the top of many desktop application
windows. A menu is usually opened, or made visible, by activating a menu button, choosing an item in a menu that opens a sub menu,
or by invoking a command, such as Shift + F10 in Windows, that opens a context specific menu. When a user activates a choice in a
menu, the menu usually closes unless the choice opened a submenu.

A menu contains slotted menu items, or DOM content.  While any DOM content can be slotted into a menu freely, only `nimble-menu-item`'s will receive keyboard navigation support.  

For example: <Story id="menu--slotted-menu"/>

The `nimble-menu` also has styling for slotted `<header>` and `<hr>` tags for labeling and organizing content.
