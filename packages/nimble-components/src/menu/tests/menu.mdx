Per [W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menubar/) - A menu is a widget that offers a list of choices to the user,
such as a set of actions or functions. Menu widgets behave like native operating system menus, such as the menus that pull down from the
menubars commonly found at the top of many desktop application windows. A menu is usually opened, or made visible, by activating a menu button,
choosing an item in a menu that opens a sub menu, or by invoking a command, such as Shift + F10 in Windows, that opens a context specific menu.
When a user activates a choice in a menu, the menu usually closes unless the choice opened a submenu.

The <Tag name={menuTag}/> supports several child elements including `<header>`, `<hr>`, <Tag name={menuItemTag} open/> and <Tag name={anchorMenuItemTag} open/>.

<Canvas of={menuStories.menu} />
<Controls of={menuStories.menu} />

## Child Elements

-   <Tag name={menuItemTag} /> - Use this child element to execute a function when
    the item is activated or to include a sub-menu. To include a sub-menu, place
    a <Tag name={menuTag} /> as a child of a <Tag name={menuItemTag} />.
-   <Tag name={anchorMenuItemTag} /> - Use this child element to navigate to a URL
    when the item is activated.

### Anchor Menu Item Target Configuration

## Custom Header

The menu can be configured to display a custom header with arbitrary content. This could include other nimble components, or even custom elements.

For example:

<Canvas of={menuStories.customMenu} />
