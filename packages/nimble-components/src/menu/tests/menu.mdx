Per [W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menubar/) - A menu is a widget that offers a list of choices to the user,
such as a set of actions or functions. Menu widgets behave like native operating system menus, such as the menus that pull down from the
menubars commonly found at the top of many desktop application windows. A menu is usually opened, or made visible, by activating a menu button,
choosing an item in a menu that opens a sub menu, or by invoking a command, such as Shift + F10 in Windows, that opens a context specific menu.
When a user activates a choice in a menu, the menu usually closes unless the choice opened a submenu.

The `nimble-menu` supports several child elements including `<header>`, `<hr>`, `<nimble-menu-item>` and `<nimble-anchor-menu-item>`.

<DocsStory of={menuStories.menu} expanded={false} />
<Controls of={menuStories.menu} />

# Usage Docs

## Child Elements

-   `nimble-menu-item` - Use this child element to execute a function when the item is activated or to include a sub-menu. To include a sub-menu, place a `nimble-menu` as a child of a `nimble-menu-item`.
-   `nimble-anchor-menu-item` - Use this child element to navigate to a URL when the item is activated.

### Anchor Menu Item Target Configuration

<TargetDocs />

## Custom Header

The menu can be configured to display a custom header with arbitrary content. This could include other nimble components, or even custom elements.

For example:

<DocsStory of={menuStories.customMenu} expanded={false} />
