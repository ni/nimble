## Accessibility

When using an icon standalone, and it has a meaning that is not otherwise communicated by adjacent text, set the `role` attribute to `graphics-symbol` and the `aria-label` attribute to a descriptive label that should be used as the accessible name. When slotting an icon into another component, if that component's accessible name fully describes its semantics, it is not neccessary to give the icon its own role and accessible name. For example, when slotting a "+" icon into a button labeled "Add File", the button's label serves as the accessible name and fully describes the button's semantics. In that case, the "+" icon is purely decorative. However, if the button's label was just "File", it would be neccessary to set the icon's role and its `aria-label` to "Add".
