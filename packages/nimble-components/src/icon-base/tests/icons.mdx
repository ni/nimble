## Accessibility

An icon's image should never be the sole way for a user to understand its meaning. Always provide additional context via adjacent visible text or via a `title` for sighted mouse users and a `role` and `aria-label` for users of accessibility technology. Set the `role` attribute to `img` and the `aria-label` and `title` attributes to a descriptive label.

For example, when slotting a "+" icon into a button labeled "Add File", the button's label serves as the accessible name and fully describes the button's semantics. In that case, the "+" icon is purely decorative. However, if the button's label was just "File", it would be neccessary to set the icon's role and its `aria-label` to "Add".
