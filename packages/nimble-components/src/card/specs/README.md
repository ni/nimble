# Nimble Card

## Overview

The `nimble-card` is a container that is designed to contain arbitrary content specified by a client
application. The `nimble-card` is intended for grouping related content.

### Background

[GitHub Issue #296: nimble-card component](https://github.com/ni/nimble/issues/296)

An IxD and Visual Design spec for the `nimble-card` component have not yet been provided. We will add some
preliminary styling in the interim. The component will remain "Incubating" until we get agreement on the
interaction and visual design.

The new Routines UX in SystemLink Enterprise calls for grouping related configuration in a slide-out in labeled
containers. See [Figma: NorthStar Vision for SLE Routines](https://www.figma.com/file/VQ7WIi3qqRG3r19VXqVvem/Stratus-Routines?type=design&node-id=1%3A74129&mode=design&t=KfPTwy4IhHbt42LR-1).
We are designing the `nimble-card` component to address that use case.

## Design

The `nimble-card` will include a `default` slot to hold arbitrary content and a `title` slot to make it easy for
clients to add a title with the correct styling and to enforce consistency across usages. Adding a `title` slot
requires creating our own template rather than using the `fast-card` template. For accessibility, we will use a
`section` element in the template, which will use `aria-labelledby` to set the label to the text of the `title` slot.

```html
<section aria-labelledby="title">
    <slot name="title" id="title"></slot>
    <slot></slot>
</section>
```

Since our target use case includes a title and we don't plan to provide styling for a non-title use case for now,
the `title` slot should not be optional. If there is a use case for a card without a title in the future, we can
follow the pattern used by the `nimble-banner`, which involves adding a `title-hidden` attribute and using the
`accessibly-hidden` utility to allow the title to be set for accessibility but not be rendered visually. The storybook
documentation for the title should indicate that it is required for accessibility reasons, similar to the existing
`nimble-banner` documentation.

Some component libraries provide a card component with additional built-in, pre-styled content or pre-styled child
components to use inside the card component (header, footer, actions, etc.). See the [Angular Material `mat-card` component](https://v5.material.angular.io/components/card/overview)
for an example. We could add similar content in the future, but it is not required at this time.

Here is an example usage for the `nimble-card` component:

```html
<nimble-card>
    <span slot="title">Title</span>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
    <nimble-button>Button</nimble-button>
</nimble-card>
```

While we don't have a finalized visual design spec, we expect the style will include a background color and a
border. The GitHub issue mentions several use cases for a card component that might call for different visual
treatments, but we are only solving for the Routines use case at this time (grouping related configuration in
a slide-out). To support other use cases in the future, we could potentially add appearance variants.

We will hold off on adding new design tokens for the `nimble-card` until we get the visual design more settled,
because we don't know if we will require different tokens from the existing components.

### API

[`fast-card` spec](https://github.com/microsoft/fast/blob/b78c921ec4e49ec9d7ec980f079ec114045df42e/packages/web-components/fast-foundation/src/card/card.spec.md)

-   _Component Name_
    -   `nimble-card`
-   _Properties/Attributes_
    -   _(none)_
-   _Methods_
    -   _(none)_
-   _Events_
    -   _(none)_
-   _CSS Classes and Custom Properties that affect the component_
    -   _(none)_
-   _Slots_
    -   `title`
        -   A title to display in the `nimble-card`
    -   `(default)`
        -   Arbitrary content to display in the `nimble-card`.

### Angular integration

We will create an Angular `nimble-card` directive for the component. The `nimble-card` does not require form integration, so there
is no need for a ControlValueAccessor.

### Blazor integration

We will create a Blazor wrapper the component and define a `NimbleCard` class. The `nimble-card` component supports child content,
so it will need a `ChildContent` parameter.

### Additional requirements

-   _User interaction: Do the FAST component's behaviors match the visual design spec? When they differ, which approach is preferable and why?_
    -   No additional requirements. The initial `nimble-card` will have no interactions.
-   _Styling: Does FAST provide APIs to achieve the styling in the visual design spec?_
    -   No additional requirements expected here.
-   _Testing: Is FAST's coverage sufficient? Should we write any tests beyond Chromatic visual tests?_
    -   No additional requirements
-   _Documentation: Any requirements besides standard Storybook docs and updating the Example Client App demo?_
    -   No additional requirements
-   _Tooling: Any new tools, updates to tools, code generation, etc?_
    -   No additional requirements
-   _Accessibility: keyboard navigation/focus, form input, use with assistive technology, etc._
    -   We will use a `section` element in the template, which will use `aria-labelledby` to set the label to the text of the `title` slot.
    -   The `nimble-card` itself does not receive keyboard focus and tabbing jumps to the first focusable component inside the `nimble-card`.
-   _Mobile: small screens, touch interactions, mobile-specific integrations_
    -   No additional requirements. By default, the `nimble-card` will fit its height to its content and grow/shrink horizontally to
        fit its parent container. Other mobile-friendly considerations are up to the client and the settings on the child components.
-   _Globalization: special RTL handling, swapping of icons/visuals, localization, etc._
    -   No additional requirements
-   _Performance: does the FAST component meet Nimble's performance requirements?_
    -   No additional requirements
-   _Security: Any requirements for security?_
    -   No additional requirements
