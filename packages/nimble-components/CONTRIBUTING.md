# Contributing to Nimble Components

## Package overview

This package contains a library of NI-styled web components.

The library is built on the open source [FAST Design System library](https://fast.design) created by Microsoft. This provides several useful starting points:

1. A small, performant custom element base class, [FAST Element](https://www.fast.design/docs/fast-element/getting-started).
2. [Infrastructure for design system features](https://www.fast.design/docs/design-systems/overview) like design tokens and theming.
3. A library of [core components](https://explore.fast.design/components/) that
    - are unopinionated in their style and easily stylable
    - adherent to browser standards like accessibility
    - while not meeting all of NI's use cases, give us a good starting point and extension capabilities
    - offer a promising future [roadmap](https://github.com/microsoft/fast/tree/master/specs#web-component-specifications)

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHOKYItVQvc) (1 hour but watchable in less time at 2x) and [this cheat sheet](https://www.fast.design/docs/resources/cheat-sheet/) are great ways to get up to speed with the architecture of FAST in no time. ðŸ’¨

## Getting started

From the `nimble` directory:

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Run the different Nimble Components test configurations:

    - To view the components and manually test behaviors in Storybook: `npm run storybook -w @ni/nimble-components`

        **Note**: You will need to refresh your browser window to see style changes made in source.

    - To run the unit tests and re-run the tests on source changes: `npm run tdd:watch -w @ni/nimble-components`

## Visual design spec process

Components added to Nimble are based on specs created by NI visual designers. See [Tips for using Adobe XD to inspect component designs](/packages/nimble-components/docs/xd-tips.md) to learn more about how to navigate these specs.

## Component spec process

Before building a new component, create a spec document to get agreement on the component's behavior, API, and high-level implementation. The spec process is described in the [`/specs` folder](/specs/README.md).

## Development workflow

1. When creating new components, create the folder structure and decide how to implement the component as described in [Develop new components](#develop-new-components).
2. Run the Storybook command from the `nimble` directory:

    `npm run storybook -w @ni/nimble-components`

    Storybook will build its own copy of the component in a temporary folder which is separate from the normal build.

3. Make functional and style changes to the component.

    The storybook will hot reload when you save changes, but the styles will not. On each save that changes `index.ts` or `styles.ts`, **you will need to refresh your browser window to see style changes**.

4. Create or update tests.

    To build and run the tests once, from the `nimble` directory run:

    `npm run tdd -w @ni/nimble-components`

    To watch for changes and automatically re-run tests on changes, from the `nimble` directory run:

    `npm run tdd:watch -w @ni/nimble-components`

    See [Unit tests](#unit-tests) for additional available commands.

5. Create changelists for your work by running the following from the `nimble` directory:

    `npm run change`

6. Update the [Component Status table](/README.md#component-status) to reflect the new component state.

## Develop new components

### Folder structure

Create a new folder named after your component with some core files:

| File                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| component-name.spec.md                 | Contains the original API and implementation specification for the component.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| index.ts                               | Contains the component class definition and registration. All TypeScript logic contained in the component belongs here.                                                                                                                                                    |
| styles.ts                              | Contains the styles relevant to this component. Note: Style property values that can be shared across components belong in [theme-provider/design-tokens.ts](/packages/nimble-components/src/theme-provider/design-tokens.ts).                                             |
| template.ts                            | Contains the template definition for components that don't use a fast-foundation template.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| tests/component-name.spec.ts           | Unit tests for this component. Covers behaviors added to components on top of existing Foundation behaviors or behavior of new components.                                                                                                                                 |
| tests/component-name.stories.ts        | Contains the component hosted in Storybook. This provides a live component view for development and testing. In the future, this will also provide API documentation.                                                                                                      |
| tests/component-name-matrix.stories.ts | Contains a story that shows all component states for all themes hosted in Storybook. This is used by Chromatic visual tests to verify styling changes across all themes and states.                                                                                        |
| tests/component-name-docs.stories.ts   | Contains the Storybook documentation for this component. This should provide design guidance and usage information. See [Creating Storybook Component Documentation](/packages/nimble-components/docs/creating-storybook-component-documentation.md) for more information. |

### Add to component bundle

All components should have an import added to `src/all-components.ts` so they are available in bundled distribution files.

### Decide how to build on top of FAST

#### Extend Fast Foundation

If Fast Foundation contains a component similar to what you're adding, create a new class that extends the existing component with any Nimble-specific functionality. Do not prefix the new class name with "Nimble"; namespacing is accomplished through imports. Use `MyComponent.compose()` to add the component to Nimble.

If your component is the canonical representation of the FAST Foundation base class that it extends, then in the argument to `compose` provide a `baseClass` value. No two Nimble components should specify the same `baseClass` value. Make sure to include a test that shows the tag name for the element is found when using `DesignSystem.tagFor(FastFoundationBaseClass)`.

Use the `css` tagged template helper to style the component according to Nimble guidelines. See [leveraging-css.md](https://github.com/microsoft/fast/blob/c94ad896dda3d4c806585d1d0bbfb37abdc3d758/packages/web-components/fast-element/docs/guide/leveraging-css.md) for (hopefully up-to-date) tips from FAST.

```ts
import { Button as FoundationButton } from '@microsoft/fast-foundation';
const styles = css`
    ${/* My custom CSS for the nimble fancy button */ ''}
    :host {
        color: gold;
    }
`;
export class Button extends FoundationButton {
    // Add new functionality (or leave empty if just restyling the FAST component)
}
const nimbleButton = Button.compose({
    baseClass: FoundationButton,
    styles
    // ...
});
```

#### Compose Elements into a new Component

If you need to compose multiple elements into a new component, use previously built Nimble elements or basic HTML elements as your template building blocks.
Extend `FoundationElement` and use a simple, unprefixed name, e.g. `QueryBuilder`.

Use the `html` tagged template helper to define your custom template. See [Declaring Templates](https://www.fast.design/docs/fast-element/declaring-templates) for tips from FAST. Reference other nimble components using `context.tagFor(NimbleComponentClass)` where `context` is the `ElementDefinitionContext` instead of hard coding the nimble tag name in the template. This improves the maintainability of the repo because it ensures usages of a component will be updated if it is renamed.

### Adhere to architectural philosophies

#### Coding conventions

This package follows the [NI JavaScript and TypeScript Styleguide](https://github.com/ni/javascript-styleguide) with some exceptions listed in [Coding Conventions](/packages/nimble-components/docs/coding-conventions.md).

#### API naming

Use lower-kebab-case for attributes and enum values that are part of a component's public API.

```ts
    @attr({ attribute: 'error-text' })
    public errorText: string | undefined;
```

#### CSS

Component CSS should follow the patterns described in [CSS Guidelines](/packages/nimble-components/docs/css-guidelines.md).

#### Comments

At a minimum all classes should have a block comment and ultimately all parts of the public API should have a block comment as well.

#### Behaviors

When configuring different variants of a single element, use behaviors.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
import { css } from '@microsoft/fast-element';
css`
    /* ... */
`.withBehaviors(
    // ...
);
```

### Adhere to accessibility guidelines

Accessibility is a requirement for all new components. For the Nimble design system, this means

-   Focus states are defined for every element and work on all browsers.
-   Colors have sufficient contrast across all themes.
-   **TODO: UX to fill out requirements.**

This is a collaborative effort between development and design. Designers will do their due diligence to make sure that designs promote accessiblity, and developers must ensure that each design is implemented and tested across browsers and themes.

### Animations

We're using the [fast-animation package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/fast-animation) for some animations (see the Drawer component as an example). That package allows us to create and start animations from JS/TS code, gives us ways to group/sequence multiple animations together, and lets us be notified when animations complete.

For new component animations, using fast-animation is preferred for complex/sequenced animations, and animations which will have additional JS/TS logic when they finish. CSS animations can still be used for simple standalone animations with no start/end JS/TS logic.

In either case, animations should honor the [prefers-reduced-motion CSS media feature](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion). This repo has examples to support that in both TS code (for fast-animation) and in CSS, [search for `prefers-reduced-motion`](https://github.com/ni/nimble/search?q=prefers-reduced-motion) for examples.

### Leveraging icons

Nimble components should leverage inline svg icons from nimble tokens. The icons are exported from nimble tokens as svg strings similar to the following format:

```ts
export const fancy16X16: {
    name: 'fancy_16_x_16';
    data: string;
} = {
    name: 'fancy_16_x_16',
    data: `<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><!-- svg path data --></svg>`
};
```

Use the `data` property to get the svg string:

```ts
import { fancy16X16 } from '@ni/nimble-tokens/dist/icons/js';

const fancyCheckbox = FoundationCheckbox.compose<CheckboxOptions>({
    // To populate an existing slot with an svg icon
    fancyIndicator: fancy16X16.data
    // ...
});
```

### Icon components

The project uses a code generation build script to create a Nimble component for each icon provided by nimble tokens. The script is run as part of the `npm run build` command, and can be run individually by invoking `npm run generate-icons`. The generated icon components are not checked into source control, so the icons must be generated before running the TypeScript compilation. The code generation source can be found at `nimble-components/build/generate-icons`.

### TypeScript integration

For any custom element definition, extend TypeScript's `HTMLElementTagNameMap` to register the new element. For example:

```js
declare global {
    interface HTMLElementTagNameMap {
        // register tag name and type of custom element
        'nimble-button': Button;
    }
}
```

This enables TypeScript to infer the type of a returned element based on its tag name for DOM methods such as `document.createElement()` and `document.querySelector()`.

### Focus delegation

Consider whether or not the `delegatesFocus` shadow DOM option should be set to `true` for the component.

Some guidelines to follow when deciding whether or not to set `delegatesFocus`:

-   For a component built on top of a fast-foundation component, check the fast-foundation component's README.md to see if the component was built with the expectation that focus will be delegated.
-   Non-interactive elements should keep `delegatesFocus` with the default `false` value.
-   Interactive controls that contain no focusable components in the shadow root should keep `delegatesFocus` with the default `false` value.
-   Interactive controls that contain focusable components in the shadow root should set `delegatesFocus` to `true`.
-   Refer to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attachShadow#parameters) or [this table](https://github.com/TakayoshiKochi/tabindex-focus-navigation-explainer/blob/master/TabindexFocusNavigationExplainer.md#proposed-solution) for more information.

If it is determined that the component should delegate focus, it can be configured as shown below:

```js
const nimbleButton = Button.compose({
    // ...
    shadowOptions: {
        delegatesFocus: true
    }
});
```

## Unit tests

Unit tests are written using karma and jasmine in files named `<component-name>.spec.ts`.

The following commands can be run from the `nimble` directory:

### Development commands

-   `npm run tdd:watch -w @ni/nimble-components`: Starts a process for building the components and running the test suite on file changes.

    This command runs headlessly. See [Debugging commands](#debugging-commands) if you need to see the browser or set breakpoints while running.

-   `npm run tdd -w @ni/nimble-components`: Similar to the corresponding `tdd:watch` command but only runs once. Useful for infrastructure changes which do not trigger the watch command.

### Debugging commands

-   `npm run test-chrome:debugger -w @ni/nimble-components`: When run opens a Chrome window that can be used for interactive debugging. Using dev tools set breakpoints in tests and refresh the page, etc.

    You can also take the page url and open it in a different browser to test interactively.

### Test utilities

Test utilities located in [`/src/testing`](/packages/nimble-components/src/testing) may be used for testing:

-   performed inside the `@ni/nimble-components` package or
-   by other packages in the monorepo or users consuming the built package

Test utilties located in [`/src/utilities/tests`](/packages/nimble-components/src/utilities/tests) are just for tests in the `@ni/nimble-components` package and are not shared externally.

#### Fixtures

The jasmine unit tests utilize [`fixture.ts`](/packages/nimble-components/src/utilities/tests/fixture.ts) for component tests. The fixture utility gives tools for managing the component lifecycle. For some usage examples see [`fixture.spec.ts`](/packages/nimble-components/src/utilities/tests/fixture.spec.ts).

## Theming

Nimble includes three NI-brand aligned themes (i.e. `light`, `dark`, & `color`).

When creating a new component, create a `*-matrix.stories.ts` Storybook file to confirm that the component reflects the design intent across all themes and states.

## Token naming

Public names for theme-aware tokens are specified in `src/theme-provider/design-token-names.ts`. Use the following structure when creating new tokens.

`[element]-[part]-[state]-[token_type]`

1. Where **element** is the type to which the token applies (e.g. 'application', 'body', or 'title-plus-1').
2. Where **part** is the specific part of the element to which the token applies (e.g. 'border', 'background', or shadow).
3. Where **state** is the more specific state descriptor (e.g. 'selected' or 'disabled'). Multiple states should be sorted alphabetically.
4. Where **token_type** is the token category (e.g. 'color', 'font', 'font-color', 'height', 'width', or 'size').
