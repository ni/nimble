# Component status

Here are components that are either implemented or on the roadmap for Nimble. Something missing? [File a request](https://github.com/ni/nimble/issues/new/choose)!

## Legend

-   ✅ means the component is ready for general use
-   ⚠️ is used for components that are "[incubating](/docs/incubating-docs--docs)". These are not ready for general use and may make breaking changes without a "major" semantic version bump.
-   ⭕ means the component doesn't exist yet. Please submit requests by commenting on the linked issue.
