# Combobox, Select, & Menu Button Usage

### What's the same?
The `nimble-select`, `nimble-combobox`, and `nimble-menu-button` are all Nimble components used for presenting a list 
of options to the user. 

### What's the difference?
`nimble-select` is used for simple selection tasks with predefined options, 
`nimble-combobox` is used when there are many options or users need to search for a specific value, and 
`nimble-menu-button` is used for presenting a list of options, commands, or links to the user.

## Select

The `nimble-select` component is a form element that presents a dropdown list of options to the user. It allows the 
user to select only one option from the list. The 'select' element is designed for simple and straightforward 
selection tasks where the options are predefined and limited.

## Combobox

The `nimble-combobox` component is a more complex form element that allows users to enter a value or choose from a 
list of predefined options. It combines an editable input field with a dropdown list of options. Users can either type 
in a value or select an option from the dropdown list. Comboboxes are commonly used in situations where there are many 
options to choose from, or when users need to quickly search for a specific value.

## Menu Button

<Story of={menuButtonStories.outlineButton} />

The `nimble-menu-button` component is a button that opens a dropdown menu when clicked. The menu can contain a list of 
options, commands, or links. Menu Buttons are commonly used in toolbars to provide easy access to frequently 
used commands or lists of links to the user.
