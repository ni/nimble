# Blazor Workspace

This workspace contains:
1. Blazor components and styles matching the NI brand. These are published as Nuget packages to be consumed by either Blazor WebAssembly or Blazor Server applications.
2. Three Blazor demo applications that consume the components: a Blazor WebAssembly application (`Demo.Client`), a Blazor Server application (`Demo.Server`), and a Blazor Hybrid application (`Demo.Hybrid`).

Refer to the `README.md` files in the individual project directories for more details.
