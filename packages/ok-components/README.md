# Ok Components

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ni/ok-components.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ni/ok-components)

Components built using the same technologies (FAST, native web components, etc.) as other nimble packages, but not part of the core design system.

Compared to the general purpose components in the `nimble-components` library, `ok-components` are components that are leveraging Nimble infrastructure but have varied ownership. See individual component documentation for details.
