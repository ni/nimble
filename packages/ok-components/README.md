# Ok Components

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ni/ok-components.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ni/ok-components)

Experimental components built using the same technologies (FAST, native web components, etc.) as other nimble packages, but not part of the core design system.

The `ok-components` package is intended for components that do not belong in [`nimble-components`](/packages/nimble-components) due to being prototypes or experimental.
