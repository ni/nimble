# Spright Components

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ni/spright-components.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ni/spright-components)

The `spright-components` package is intended for components that do not belong in `nimble-components` due to being: ["molecules"](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/), product-specific, data-connected, or not "general utility". The primary component implementation should still be built on Nimble technologies (FAST, native web components, etc).
