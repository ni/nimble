# Spright Components

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ni/spright-components.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ni/spright-components)

NI-styled web components following [Nimble Design System](https://nimble.ni.dev) patterns and built on the same technologies (FAST, native web components, etc.), but not part of the core design system.

Compared to the general purpose components in the `nimble-components` library, `spright-components` are application-specific or context-specific components that may be purpose built or coupled to specific technologies, products, or domains.
