# Google Web Fonts

Original font sources:

* [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)

Converted to WOFF2 format using [a tff to woff2](https://everythingfonts.com/ttf-to-woff2) recommended by [google-webfonts-helper](https://github.com/majodev/google-webfonts-helper)

# Adding new fonts

New font assets should be added to the `nimble-tokens/dist/fonts/assets` directory and referenced in from `nimble-tokens/dist/fonts/css/fonts.css` so that they will be loaded by applications using nimble.
