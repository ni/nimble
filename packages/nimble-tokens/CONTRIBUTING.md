## Getting started

1. Build the monorepo, see [Getting Started](/CONTRIBUTING.md#getting-started)
2. Ensure you have the [Adobe XD extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Adobe.xd&ssr=false#overview) installed.

## Editing Tokens

New tokens are added to this package with the [Adobe XD Visual Studio extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Adobe.xd&ssr=false#overview).

The source of truth for the colors, fonts, and component design tokens in this repository is an Adobe XD [Design Library file](https://xd.adobe.com/view/33ffad4a-eb2c-4241-b8c5-ebfff1faf6f6-66ac/) maintained by the Visual Design team.

For changes to any token values, work with the Visual Design team to update the library, and then perform the following steps:

1. Open the XD extension (invoke [Show All Commands](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_navigation) and execute command `XD: Toggle Adobe XD Panel`) and load the nimble-tokens-dsp package by selecting the `nimble-tokens` folder.
2. Click the **DSP Setting** button (bottom left). If the button is not available, open the XD extension settings to confirm that the `XD: Global Editor` setting is **checked** for both user and workspace.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the DSP Setting page and click the **Re-import** button to update the CC LIBRARY LINK.
4. Save the settings change.
5. Click the **Start Editing** button and then the **Stop Editing** button to trigger the StyleDictionary token build.
6. Commit these changes to the repo.

For any token metadata changes (e.g. documentation, code snippets, etc.):

1. Follow step 1 above.
2. Click the **Start Editing** button and make your changes.
3. Click the **Stop Editing** button to trigger a token build.
4. Commit these changes to the repo.

## Updating icons

1. Export high-quality, optimized SVG files from the `source/icons/Nimble_Iconography.ai` icon source file, by using the **Export for Screens…** workflow within Adobe Illustrator to export SVG files:

   1. Choose **File » Export » Export for Screens…**

      <img src="docs/ai-export-1.png" width="600">

   2. In the Export for Screen prompt, confirm that files will be exported to the `dist/icons/svg` folder, and that the remaining settings match the screenshot below.

   3. Confirm that the SVG settings match the screenshot below.

      <img src="docs/ai-export-3.png" width="600">

   4. Choose to replace any existing files in the `dist/icons/svg` folder.

      <img src="docs/ai-export-4.png" width="600"> 

2. Search for all `<defs>.*</defs>` tags in the exported `.svg` files (in the `packages/nimble-tokens/dist/icons/svg` directory), and remove them. This removes all color from the `.svg` files and allows us to dynamically change the fill color.

3. Confirm the new icon files will build correctly by running: `npm run build -w @ni/nimble-tokens`.
4. Add metadata for the new icons to `nimble-components\src\icon-base\icon-metadata.ts`.
5. Generate and build icon components by running `npm run build -w @ni/nimble-components`.
6. Preview the built files by running: `npm run storybook -w @ni/nimble-components`, and review the **Icons** story to confirm that your changes appear correctly.
7. Publish a PR with your changes. If there are any new icons, set `changeType` and `dependentChangeType` to minor in the beachball change file.
