## Getting started

1. Build the monorepo, see [Getting Started](/CONTRIBUTING.md#getting-started)

## Editing Base Tokens

Base tokens are generated using the [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) build system, which transforms platform-agnostic token definition files into platform-specific output. These JSON definition files are the source of truth for the colors, fonts, and component design tokens in this repository. To modify the generated tokens, complete these steps:

1. Edit the JSON files in `source/styledictionary/properties`. Long term these tokens will be sourced from a Figma design spec but for now it's OK to make manual edits.
2. Rebuild the generated token files by running the repository's build command, `npm run build`.
3. Test your changes locally and create a PR using the normal process.

To style a component with token values, you must first map base tokens to [theme-aware tokens](/packages/nimble-components/CONTRIBUTING.md#theme-aware-tokens).

## Updating icons

### Icon naming

Use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) names for icons. If Font Awesome doesn't contain an equivalent icon, minimize the use of metaphors; choose descriptive and unambiguous names instead.

| ✅ Descriptive name    | ❌ Metaphor            |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| `key`                  | `access-control`       |
| `cog`                  | `system-configuration` |
| `arrow-left-from-line` | `logout`               |

Add all appropriate metaphors and synonyms to the `icon-metadata.ts` file, so clients can quickly find icons in Storybook. You can find ideas for synonyms in the [Font Awesome metadata](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/blob/master/metadata/icons.yml).

### Extract icons from Adobe Illustrator

These steps require access to Adobe Illustrator and Perforce so will typically be completed by Brandon O'Keefe, Fred Visser, or another designer.

1. Get the latest copy of the icon source file from NI internal Perforce at `//NIComponents/VisualDesign/ProductionAssets/DiagramPaletteAssets_XML/Nimble/trunk/20.0/source/Nimble_Iconography.ai`.
2. Export high-quality, optimized SVG files from the icon source file, by using the **Export for Screens…** workflow within Adobe Illustrator to export SVG files:

   1. Choose **File » Export » Export for Screens…**

      <img src="docs/ai-export-1.png" width="600">

   2. In the Export for Screen prompt, confirm that files will be exported to the `dist/icons/svg` folder, and that the remaining settings match the screenshot below.

   3. Confirm that the SVG settings match the screenshot below.

      <img src="docs/ai-export-3.png" width="600">

   4. Choose to replace any existing files in the `dist/icons/svg` folder.

3. Proceed to the steps below or [create a user story](https://github.com/ni/nimble/issues/new/choose) requesting that the Nimble team perform them. If filing an issue, attach the new and modified SVG files and also `Nimble_Iconography.ai` to the issue.

### Adding icons to Nimble

1. In a new branch, copy the Illustrator file to `source/icons/Nimble_Iconography.ai` and the SVG files to `dist/icons/svg`.
2. Search for all `<defs>.*</defs>` tags in the exported `.svg` files and remove them. This removes all color from the `.svg` files and allows us to dynamically change the fill color.

3. Confirm the new icon files will build correctly by running: `npm run build -w @ni/nimble-tokens`.
4. Generate and build icon components by running `npm run build -w @ni/nimble-components`. This step will report an error at this point but is necessary to enable the next step.
5. Add metadata for the new icons to `nimble-components/src/icon-base/tests/icon-metadata.ts`.
6. Run `npm run build -w @ni/nimble-components` again. It should now succeed.
7. Preview the built files by running: `npm run storybook -w @ni/nimble-components`, and review the **Icons** story to confirm that your changes appear correctly. Inspect the icons in each **Severity** and ensure their color changes. Ensure the table is large enough to see all icons without nested scrollbars.
8. Publish a PR with your changes. If there are any new icons, set `changeType` and `dependentChangeType` to minor in the beachball change file.
