# Spright components

These components adhere to Nimble's styling and API conventions, but are not
part of the core design system due to having one or more of the following
characteristics:

-   more complex ["molecules"](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/)
    composed of Nimble "atom" components
-   inherently product-specific in a way that makes reuse by other applications
    unlikely
-   data-connected
-   otherwise lacking general utility

Spright components are production-quality, but may not have the same level of
documentation or cross-framework support as Nimble components.
