# Component Status

Components are organized into several different libraries based on their intended use:

- **Nimble Components**: General purpose components that are suitable for use in each and every application.
- **Spright Components**: Application-specific or context-specific components that may be purpose built or coupled to specific technologies, products, or domains.
- **Ok Components**: Components that are leveraging Nimble infrastructure but have varied ownership.

Here are components that are either implemented or on the roadmap for Nimble.

## Nimble Components

- Very general purpose, low-level core primitives (["Atoms"](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#atoms)).
- Focused on API consistency and compatibility between other Nimble components.
- Alignment with native HTML elements and the web platform APIs where comparable.
- Nimble developers own and actively maintain for upgrades, issues, etc.

## Spright Components

- Purpose built components that may be application, product, or domain specific.
- Frequently higher-level compositions of components (["Molecules"](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#atoms)) or low-level primitives that are not general purpose.
- Encouraged to align with Nimble component patterns but have more flexibility.
- Nimble developers co-own and enforce technical implementation along with component-specific owners to maintain Nimble standards.

## Ok Components

- Components that leverage Nimble infrastructure varying from production quality to undergoing rapid iterative development.
- Users should consult with component-specific owners before leveraging in new applications.
- Nimble infrastructure owned by Nimble developers but components owned by component-specific owners.
