### Guidance for filtering users

Initially, the client application need not provide any user mapping elements within the children of `nimble-rich-text-mention-users`. It can be empty. 
However, if the editor loads with an initial markdown string that contains user mentions, then the client should load those user mapping elements. 
This is to map the user IDs in the markdown string converted to a readable user name in the editor. Therefore, it is advisable to keep two lists, 
`filteredOptions` for dynamic filtering of users to populate in the @mention popup and `mentionedUsers` for storing the already mentioned users which 
should be loaded initially by the client to represent the user names that are stored in markdown. Later, the `mentionedUsers` will be filtered internally 
within the Nimble editor or by the client to show the names in the popup whenever texts added after @ in the editor.

The `nimble-rich-text-mention-users` component will emit an event whenever the @ character is entered into the editor. The client can listen to the 
`mention-update` event and provide the other initial user lists that are not mentioned already.

It is recommended to sort the usernames in alphabetical order and send at most 20 users list at a time to reduce the number of elements in the DOM 
for a single page. This dynamic loading of the user's list will help when there are a lot of @mention instances on a single page. If the users list is 
very large, it may cause the page to load slower as the mapping mention element is overflowed in the DOM when there are multiple editors in a single
page or a large number of users in the client organization.

The `mention-update` event will also be triggered when the user types any character after @, containing that text along with the @ character in the 
event data. For example, if a user types @ and then adds `a` the event will be emitted with data that includes the value @a. The client can listen 
to this event, filter the list of users that includes the names containing the letter `a`, and then dynamically update the `nimble-mapping-mention-user` 
element based on the filter data. Subsequently, a maximum of 20 filtered options should be transmitted to the editor.

The `mention-update` event will also be triggered when a user copies a mention node from the viewer/editor and pasting it in the editor. Clients should 
read the `getMentionedHrefs()` method to identify the user URL(s) that are being pasted into the editor so that the mapping elements can be sent as a children. 
This is necessary because the corresponding name for the newly added user URL(s) is required to render as username(s) in the components so the client
should send the mapping elements for all mentioned users.

The above event triggers for every key down event like adding/removing texts and moving the text cursor after the @ character. Updating users is quite an 
expensive operation to perform for every keystroke so it is advisable to debounce the events if you're using network requests to perform the filtering 
operations. For example, allow at most one request per second to filter the list for each second instead of for each keystrokes.

Note: The editor will also perform the same filtering once again to ensure the filtered options are proper and update the dropdown list in the UI. 
This helps to filter the list, regardless of whether the client is loading the list dynamically by listening to the event as mentioned above or statically 
providing user details at the start via `nimble-mapping-mention`.
