## Styling

### Sizing

The 64px spinner is a less commonly used size reserved for large negative empty
space. Only one 64px spinner should be used on a single screen at one time.

The 32px spinner is a more commonly used size for negative empty space. No more
than three 32px spinners should be used on a single screen at one time.

The 16px spinner is the most compact option for tight spaces such as grid cells
and dense UI interfaces without much negative empty space.

Multiple 16px spinners can be used on a single screen at one time.

### Appearances

Use the `default` appearance and Color theme for UIs with a strong background
color. Do not use the `accent` appearance with the Color theme.

See the `size` and `appearance` usage details for information on customizing the
spinner size and guidance for which appearance to use.

## Accessibility

A low-motion/low-frame rate version of the spinner is also available. It can be
activated by enabling `prefers-reduced-motion`.

When using colored backgrounds, confirm with your designer that a 3:1 contrast
ratio is met.
