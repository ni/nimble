The Select control allows users to choose from a list of options displayed in a
dropdown menu.

Use <Tag name={radioTag} /> when you need to present a small set of options.

Use <Tag name={comboboxTag} /> if users should be able to enter a custom value
in addition to selecting from the list.

### List Option

### List Option Group

## Styling

By default, the select control resizes to the selected option size. In most
layouts, consider giving the select a specific `width` to align with other
items. Ensure the control is wide enough so labels do not wrap.

## Examples

### Placeholder

To display placeholder text within the select you must provide an option that
has the `disabled`, `selected` and `hidden` attributes set. This option will not
be available in the dropdown, and its contents will be used as the placeholder
text. Note that giving the placeholder an initial `selected` state is only
necessary to display the placeholder initially. If another option is selected
initially the placeholder will be displayed upon clearing the current value.

Any select without a default selected option should provide placeholder text.
Placeholder text should always follow the pattern "Select [thing(s)]", for
example "Select country". Use sentence casing and don't include punctuation at
the end of the prompt.

### Dynamic options

There are scenarios that require not all possible options to be available
initially, such as when the set of all options is too large to be loaded at
once. In such cases, users are expected to provide filter text to narrow down
the list of options. It is recommended that when option sets exceed 1000 in
number that this strategy is implemented.

The select offers the `filter-input` event to allow clients to listen for
changes to the filter input. When accompanied with the setting `filter-mode` to
`manual`, clients can perform their own filtering and provide the set of options
to the select dynamically.

Typical steps for dynamic options are as follows:

1. Set the `filter-mode` to `manual` on the select.
1. Listen for the `filter-input` event on the select.
1. In the event handler, do the following:
    - Set the `loading-visible` attribute on the select.
    - Retrieve the filter text from the event and populate the DOM with the set
      of options that match the filter text by your own logic. This can be
      asynchronous, as this often involves fetching data from a server. To
      reduce unnecessary requests, consider debouncing the filter input.
        - If the filter text is empty, the select should display all initial
          options in the dropdown in addition to the current selected option if
          it is not one of the initial options.
        - If the current selected value doesn't match the filter text, you must
          still include it among the options but set the `hidden` property so
          that it does not appear in the list.
    - Remove the `loading-visible` attribute on the select.
    - It is important that one of the options in the DOM is the currently
      selected option, as well as any option that is designated as the
      placeholder.

#### Groups

When using groups with dynamic options, clients should also match the filter
text against the group label. If the group label matches the filter text, the
group should be displayed, and all options within the group should be displayed
as well. If the group label does not match the filter text, then options within
the group should only be displayed if they match the filter text.
