Select is a control for selecting amongst a set of options. Upon clicking on the
element, the other options are visible in a dropdown.

## Examples

### Placeholder

To display placeholder text within the select you must provide an option that
has the `disabled`, `selected` and `hidden` attributes set. This option will not
be available in the dropdown, and its contents will be used as the placeholder
text. Note that giving the placeholder an initial `selected` state is only
necessary to display the placeholder initially. If another option is selected
initially the placeholder will be displayed upon clearing the current value.

Any select without a default selected option should provide placeholder text.
Placeholder text should always follow the pattern "Select [thing(s)]", for
example "Select country". Use sentence casing and don't include punctuation at
the end of the prompt.

### Dynamic Options

There are scenarios that might require not all possible options to be available
initially, such as when the set of all options is too large to be loaded at once. 
In such cases, users are expected to provide filter text to narrow down the list 
of options. The `Select` now offers the `filter-input` event to allow clients to
listen for changes to the filter input. When accompanied with the `filterMode` set
to `manual`, clients can perform their own filtering and provide the set of options
to the `Select` dynamically.

Typical steps for dynamic options are as follows:
1. Set the `filterMode` to `manual` on the `Select`.
1. Listen for the `filter-input` event on the `Select`.
1. In the event handler, retrieve the filter text from the event and populate the DOM
with the set of options that match the filter text by your own logic.
    - It is important that one of the options in the DOM is the currently selected option.
