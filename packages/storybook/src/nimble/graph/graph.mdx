import { Canvas, Meta, Controls, Title } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks';
import * as graphStories from './graph.stories';

<Meta of={graphStories} />
<Title of={graphStories} />

The Nimble Design System does not provide a graph component, but theme-aware
tokens are available for styling custom or third-party graph components to match
the Nimble Design System.

<Canvas of={tokenStories.graphTokens} />
<Controls of={tokenStories.graphTokens} />

## Usage

For monochromatic UIs using the Color theme, it is recommended to override the
default values of the graph trace tokens with colors that work with the specific
background color. Special care should be taken to ensure the colors pass
accessibility standards. Consult with a visual designer for help.
