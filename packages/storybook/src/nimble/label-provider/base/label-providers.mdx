Most user-visible strings displayed by Nimble components are provided by the
client application and are expected to be localized by the application if
necessary. However, some strings are built into Nimble components and are
provided only in English. An application can provide localized versions of these
strings by using design tokens set on label provider elements.

See the
[nimble-components](https://github.com/ni/nimble/tree/main/packages/nimble-components)
readme and contributing docs for more information.
