Anchor components in nimble should behave like native anchors in a number of different ways that are difficult to unit test in an automated manner.
Therefore, this story contains a native anchor element along with all of the nimble components that are anchors or contain anchors.
The following behaviors should be true of the nimble components:

Mouse interactions:

-   Dragging the nimble component should behave like the native anchor
    -   Known behavior exceptions:
        -   Chromium - The drag preview contains the href only, not the label of the anchor. See [chromium issue 329489154](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/329489154).
        -   Firefox - The drag preview does not contain the label, and in most cases, is blank. See [mozilla bug 1589364](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1589364).
        -   Safari - The drag preview contains the href only, not the label of the anchor.
-   CTRL + CLICK opens in a new tab (âŒ˜ + CLICK on macOS)
-   Right clicking should open the link menu
-   Hovering over the component should show the URL preview at the bottom of the browser window
-   Copying the link through the right-click link menu should result in the expected string to be copied to the clipboard
-   The hover state of the component and mouse pointer should match the area of the component that navigates when clicked (i.e. clicking the white space around the control should not navigate)

Keyboard interactions:

-   Focusing via tab should show the URL preview at the bottom of the browser window
    -   Known behavior exceptions:
        -   Firefox on macOS - Links are not focusable via tab by default. [See this stackoverflow page for how to allow tab focus of links](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11704828/how-to-allow-keyboard-focus-of-links-in-firefox).
        -   Safari - Focusing via tab does not show the URL preview at the bottom of the browser, which matches the behavior of native anchors.
-   Pressing ENTER when focused should activate the link
-   Pressing the MENU KEY on the keyboard while the link is focused should open the same link menu as a right click

Interactions specific to anchors visualized as text:

-   Selecting the link through click and drag and then copying it should result in the expected string being copied to the clipboard
