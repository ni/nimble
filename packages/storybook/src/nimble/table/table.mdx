The <Tag name={tableTag}/> is a component that offers a way to render tabular
data in a variety of ways in each column. For information about configuring
table columns, see
[Table Column Configuration](?path=/docs/components-table-column-configuration--docs)
and the **Table Column** pages for individual table column types.

## Styling

### Sizing

The <Tag name={tableTag}/> should be sized explicitly or sized to fill the space
of a parent container. The <Tag name={tableTag}/> does not currently support
being styled with `height: auto`. The ability to auto size the table is tracked
with [issue 1624](https://github.com/ni/nimble/issues/1624).

## Examples

### Delay-loaded hierarchy

In some cases, it may be known that a record has children, but the records for
those children are not known. For performance reasons, it may be preferred to
load the children on demand when a user expands the parent row. To accomplish
this, use the `setRecordHierarchyOptions()` function on the table to set the
hierarchy options associated with records in the data.

<Controls of={tableStories.delayedHierarchy} />

#### Using delay-loaded hierarchy

The expected usage of the dynamically loaded hierarchy is as follows:

1. Configure `idFieldName` and `parentIdFieldName` on the table
1. Call `setData` on the table with the records that are known
1. Call `setRecordHierarchyOptions` with an option of
   `{ delayedHierarchyState: TableRecordDelayedHierarchyState.canLoadChildren }`
   for IDs associated with records that are known to have children that have not
   been loaded.
1. Handle the `row-expand-toggle` event on the table by doing the following for
   rows that need to dynamically load their data:
    1. Start loading the data in the background.
    1. Call `setRecordHierarchyOptions` on the table to update the state of the
       row whose data is being loaded to
       `{ delayedHierarchyState: TableRecordDelayedHierarchyState.loadingChildren }`.
       This call must include the current state of any records not in the
       default state.
1. When the dynamically loaded data has finished loading, do the following based
   on the result of loading data:
    - If loading the data succeeds:
        1. Call `setData` on the table with the new data
        1. Call `setRecordHierarchyOptions` with the current row options for
           each row that is either still loading or still has data that hasn't
           been loaded yet.
    - If loading the data fails but can be tried again:
        1. Call `setRecordHierarchyOptions` to change the row state back to
           `{ delayedHierarchyState: TableRecordDelayedHierarchyState.canLoadChildren }`.
           This call must include the current state of any records not in the
           default state.
    - If loading the data determines that the row doesn't actually have
      children:
        1. Call `setRecordHierarchyOptions` to change the row state to
           `{ delayedHierarchyState: TableRecordDelayedHierarchyState.none }`.
           This call must include the current state of any records not in the
           default state.

#### Behavior of setRecordHierarchyOptions

`setRecordHierarchyOptions()` has the following behavior:

-   all options will be cleared when the table's `idFieldName` changes
-   an option passed to `setRecordHierarchyOptions` with an ID that does not
    match a record in the data will be ignored
-   the options passed to `setRecordHierarchyOptions` will override any options
    previously set to become the complete set of options configured on the table
-   the table will not render delayed hierarchy state (loading or expandable) if
    the table's `parentIdFieldName` is not configured; however, the options will
    remain cached within the table if the `parentIdFieldName` becomes
    `undefined`, and that cached configuration will render in the table if the
    table's `parentIdFieldName` is changed back to a non-`undefined` value
-   calling `setData` will clear options associated with IDs that are no longer
    present in the data

## Accessibility

### Keyboard navigation

Once the table is focused, it supports navigation via keyboard keys.

-   If the table is focused via `Tab`/`Shift-Tab`: focus starts on the first
    action button in the header row (if any), the first column header (if any
    columns are sortable), or the first row of data.
-   If the table is focused via mouse-click on a row, keyboard navigation will
    start from that row once a navigation key is pressed afterwards.

Column sorting:

-   If a column header is focused, `Enter` will toggle its sort mode between
    ascending, descending, and no sorting.
-   `Shift-Enter` will do the same but will maintain other columns as sorted if
    they were already.

Navigating the table:

-   `UpArrow`, `DownArrow`, `LeftArrow`, `RightArrow` will navigate amongst the
    table column headers, rows, and cells.
-   When a row is focused:
    -   If the row is expandable, `RightArrow` and `LeftArrow` will
        expand/collapse the row.
    -   If the row cannot be expanded (or is already expanded), a `RightArrow`
        press will focus the first cell.
    -   `Home` and `End` will focus the first and last rows in the dataset,
        respectively.
-   When a cell is focused:
    -   If the leftmost cell of a row is focused, another `LeftArrow` press will
        focus the entire row.
    -   `Home` and `End` will focus the first and last cells of the row,
        respectively.
    -   `Ctrl-Home` and `Ctrl-End` will focus the cell in the same column of the
        first and last rows of the dataset.
-   `PgUp` and `PgDown` will navigate up or down by one page's worth of rows.
    -   If a cell was focused, the cell in the same column in the new row will
        be focused.
    -   If a row was focused, the new row will be focused afterwards.

Interacting with cell contents:

-   When a cell is focused:
    -   `Enter` or `F2` will focus the first interactive element inside a cell,
        if there is one (such as an anchor).
    -   `Ctrl-Enter` will open the cell's action menu, if it has one.
-   When an action menu or element inside a cell has focus:
    -   Arrow key presses will no longer navigate between rows/cells.
    -   Pressing `Esc` or `F2` will return to row/cell navigation mode.

Row selection and grouping:

-   If a row is focused, `Space` will select the row.
-   If a row or cell is focused, `Shift-Space` will select the row. (Note, in
    multiple selection mode, this may result in ranges of rows being selected.)
-   If a group header row is focused, `Space` will expand/collapse the group. To
    select the group, navigate to the selection checkbox with `LeftArrow` and
    `RightArrow`, and toggle it with `Space`.

`Tab` and `Shift-Tab` can be used to navigate between the interactive elements
in the current row or header, such as buttons or anchors. Once those elements in
the current row have been traversed, `Tab`/`Shift-Tab` will move focus outside
the table. When the table is focused again, navigation will resume from the
previously focused element.

### Selecting multiple rows

When the table has a `selectionMode` of `multiple`, multiple rows can be
selected using the selection checkboxes. Additionally, clicking on rows has the
following behavior:

-   Clicking on a row selects just that row.
-   `CTRL` clicking on a row toggles the selection of that row while
    maintaining. the selection of other rows
    -   Note: On macOS, use the `Command` key (`⌘`) instead of `CTRL`.
-   Selecting a row followed by `SHIFT` clicking on another row selects the
    range of rows between the two rows.
-   Selecting a row followed by `SHIFT-CTRL` clicking on a different row adds
    the range of rows to the existing selection.
    -   Note: On macOS, use the `Command` key (`⌘`) instead of `CTRL`.
