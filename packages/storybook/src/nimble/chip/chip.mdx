<Meta of={chipStories} />
<Title of={chipStories} />

A component for displaying information in a compact format. Provides an optional
remove button to allow users to delete the chip.

<Canvas of={chipStories.chip} />

## API

<Controls of={chipStories.chip} />
<ComponentApisLink />

## Styling

By default the chip will grow to fit its text content, up to its `max-width`.
Applications may override the default `max-width` if needed. If your application
needs a different width behavior, please file an issue to discuss.

## Usage

When displaying multiple related chips together, the recommended configuration
is:

- chips are arranged horizontally and wrap to new lines when there is
  insufficient horizontal space
- use the `medium-padding` token to create horizontal and vertical space between
  chips
- all chips have the same appearance

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Interaction

When a chip is both selectable (`selection-mode="single"`) and removable:
- **Space/Enter**: Toggles the chip's selected state
- **Escape**: Removes the chip (emits the `remove` event)

The remove button is non-focusable when the chip is selectable to avoid nested interactive controls. Instead, use the Escape key to remove a focused chip.

When a chip is removable but not selectable (`selection-mode="none"`), the remove button is focusable and can be activated with Space or Enter.
