## Styling

### Sizing

The dialog size can be customized by modyfing the width, height and max-height
properties of `nimble-dialog::part(control)`.

By default, the dialog is sized to be small and growable. This should be used
for small dialogs like a confirmation dialog. This is equivalent of using the
following style configuration:

```scss
nimble-dialog::part(control) {
    width: $ni-nimble-dialog-small-width;
    height: $ni-nimble-dialog-small-height;
    max-height: $ni-nimble-dialog-small-max-height;
}
```

For larger dialogs, for example a wizard-like dialog, the following style
configuration should be used:

```scss
nimble-dialog::part(control) {
    width: $ni-nimble-dialog-large-width;
    height: $ni-nimble-dialog-large-height;
    max-height: $ni-nimble-dialog-large-max-height;
}
```

## Usage

By default, the first focusable control gets focus when the dialog is opened. To
focus a specific element instead, set the `autofocus` attribute on that element.

### Blazor

Using the `NimbleDialog` in a Blazor app requires it to be placed in the
template just like any other component. While it's location in the template
doesn't tend to matter, it is conventional for it to be placed at the bottom.
Opening and closing the dialog will be handled by calling the `ShowAsync` and
`CloseAsync` methods on a `NimbleDialog` reference respectively.

If your dialog contains elements that can have user-provided state (such as an
editable `NimbleTextField` or a `NimbleToggleButton`), then if it is expected
for the dialog to open in the same state each time you _must_ provide a means to
reset that state between opens (the `NimbleDialog` can not do this itself). A
common pattern to manage this is to bind the values of the elements in the
dialog to some model state, and upon closing (or opening) the dialog, simply
re-create the model the values are bound to.

MyDialogOwner.razor

```html
<NimbleDialog @ref="_dialog">
    <NimbleTextField Value="@_model.FirstName"></NimbleTextField>
    <NimbleTextField Value="@_model.LastName"></NimbleTextField>
    <NimbleButton slot="footer" @onclick="CloseDialogAsync(DialogResult.OK)"
        >OK</NimbleButton
    >
</NimbleDialog>
```

MyDialogOwner.razor.cs

```cs
private DialogData _model = new();
private NimbleDialog! _dialog;

private async Task CloseDialogAsync(DialogResult reason)
{
    await _dialog.CloseAsync(reason);
    _model = new(); // reset model state
}

private class DialogData
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}
```
