import { Canvas, Meta, Controls, Title } from '@storybook/blocks';
import * as dialogStories from './dialog.stories';

<Meta of={dialogStories} />
<Title of={dialogStories} />

A modal dialog that appears centered on top of all other windows, blocking other interaction until dismissed.

By default, the first focusable control gets focus when the dialog is opened. To focus a specific element instead, set the `autofocus` attribute on that element.

<Canvas of={dialogStories.dialog} />
<Controls of={dialogStories.dialog} />

## Sizing

The dialog size can be customized by modyfing the width, height and max-height properties of `nimble-dialog::part(control)`.

By default, the dialog is sized to be small and growable. This should be used for small dialogs like a confirmation dialog.
This is equivalent of using the following style configuration:

```scss
nimble-dialog::part(control) {
    width: $ni-nimble-dialog-small-width;
    height: $ni-nimble-dialog-small-height;
    max-height: $ni-nimble-dialog-small-max-height;
}
```

For larger dialogs, for example a wizard-like dialog, the following style configuration should be used:

```scss
nimble-dialog::part(control) {
    width: $ni-nimble-dialog-large-width;
    height: $ni-nimble-dialog-large-height;
    max-height: $ni-nimble-dialog-large-max-height;
}
```
