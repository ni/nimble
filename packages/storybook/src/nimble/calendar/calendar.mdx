import { Canvas, Meta, Controls, Title } from '@storybook/blocks';
import * as calendarStories from './calendar.stories';
import * as tokenStories from '../theme-provider/tokens.stories';

<Meta of={calendarStories} />
<Title of={calendarStories} />

The Nimble Design System does not provide a calendar component, but theme-aware
tokens are available for styling custom or third-party calendar components to
match the Nimble Design System.

<Canvas of={tokenStories.calendarTokens} />
<Controls of={tokenStories.calendarTokens} />

## Usage

For monochromatic UIs using the Color theme, it is recommended to override the
default values of the calendar tokens with colors that work with the specific
background color. Special care should be taken to ensure the colors pass
accessibility standards. Consult with a visual designer for help.
