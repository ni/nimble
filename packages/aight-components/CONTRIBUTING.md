# Contributing to Aight Components

This package generally uses the same tooling as Nimble components. See the [`nimble-components` CONTRIBUTING doc](/packages/nimble-components/CONTRIBUTING.md) for an overview.

## Code ownership

Code in Aight packages is owned the contributing team.

The Design System team will maintain infrastructure like pipelines and dependency updates. However, if an Aight component results in excessive build times, complexity during dependency updates, test instability, or is a burden on the state of the monorepo the contributing team is expected to address issues. Failing to do so will lead to components having tests disabled, build removed, and ultimately deletion from the repository.

## Code quality

Code should adhere to NI and Nimble standards for quality and test coverage. The contributing team is ultimately responsible for aligning with those practices and is encouraged to reach out to Nimble developers with questions or for feedback.

## Documentation

Aight components should leverage Storybook for documentation similar to other components.
