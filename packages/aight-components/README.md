# Aight Components

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ni/aight-components.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ni/aight-components)

Experimental components built using the same technologies (FAST, native web components, etc.) as other nimble packages, but not part of the core design system.

The `aight-components` package is intended for components that do not belong in [`nimble-components`](/packages/nimble-components) due to being prototypes or experimental.
