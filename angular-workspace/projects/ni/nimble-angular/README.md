# Nimble Angular

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ni/nimble-angular.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ni/nimble-angular)

NI-styled UI components for Angular applications

## Getting started

You are currently required to set `"buildOptimizer": "false"` in `angular.json`. See [#18](https://github.com/ni/nimble/issues/18) for more info.

### Using Nimble form controls

For best results, always use `ngModel`, `formControl`, or `formControlName` bindings when integrating Nimble form controls in Angular. Binding to the control's native value property or event (e.g. `[value]` or `(change)`) is not supported, and can cause build failures and other issues. If a value change event is necessary, use `ngModel (ngModelChange)="onChange()"`.
